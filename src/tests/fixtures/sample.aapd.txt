the relation between pearson 's correlation coefficient and salton 's cosine measure is revealed based on the different possible values of the division of the l1 norm and the l2 norm of a vector these different values yield a sheaf of increasingly straight lines which form together a cloud of points , being the investigated relation the theoretical results are tested against the author co citation relations among 24 informetricians for whom two matrices can be constructed , based on co citations the asymmetric occurrence matrix and the symmetric co citation matrix both examples completely confirm the theoretical results the results enable us to specify an algorithm which provides a threshold value for the cosine above which none of the corresponding pearson correlations would be negative using this threshold value can be expected to optimize the visualization of the vector space

the present work studies quantum and classical correlations in three qubits and four qubits general bell states , produced by operating with braid operators on the computational basis of states the analogies between the general three qubits and four qubits bell states and that of two qubits bell states are discussed the general bell states are shown to be maximal entangled , i e , with quantum correlations which are lost by tracing these states over one qubit , remaining only with classical correlations , as shown by hs decomposition

one of the most important tasks in image processing problem and machine vision is object recognition , and the success of many proposed methods relies on a suitable choice of algorithm for the segmentation of an image this paper focuses on how to apply texture operators based on the concept of fractal dimension and cooccurence matrix , to the problem of object recognition and a new method based on fractal dimension is introduced several images , in which the result of the segmentation can be shown , are used to illustrate the use of each method and a comparative study of each operator is made

frequency diverse \( fd \) radar waveforms are attractive in radar research and practice by combining two typical fd waveforms , the frequency diverse array \( fda \) and the stepped frequency \( sf \) pulse train , we propose a general fd waveform model , termed the random frequency diverse multi input multi output \( rfd mimo \) in this paper the new model can be applied to specific fd waveforms by adapting parameters furthermore , by exploring the characteristics of the clutter covariance matrix , we provide an approach to evaluate the clutter rank of the rfd mimo radar , which can be adopted as a quantitive metric for the clutter suppression potentials of fd waveforms numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the clutter rank estimation method , and reveal helpful results for comparing the clutter suppression performance of different fd waveforms

unsupervised word embeddings have been shown to be valuable as features in supervised learning problems however , their role in unsupervised problems has been less thoroughly explored in this paper , we show that embeddings can likewise add value to the problem of unsupervised pos induction in two representative models of pos induction , we replace multinomial distributions over the vocabulary with multivariate gaussian distributions over word embeddings and observe consistent improvements in eight languages we also analyze the effect of various choices while inducing word embeddings on downstream pos induction results

in this paper , we consider a particular class of selective fading channel corresponding to a channel that is selective either in time or in frequency for this class of channel , we propose a systematic way to achieve the optimal dmt derived in coronel and b olcskei , ieee isit , 2007 by extending the non vanishing determinant \( nvd \) criterion to the selective channel case a new code construction based on split nvd parallel codes is then proposed to satisfy the nvd parallel criterion this result is of significant interest not only in its own right , but also because it settles a long standing debate in the literature related to the optimal dmt of selective fading channels

the gallager bound is well known in the area of channel coding however , most discussions about it mainly focus on its applications to memoryless channels we show in this paper that the bounds obtained by gallager 's method are very tight even for general sources and channels that are defined in the information spectrum theory our method is mainly based on the estimations of error exponents in those bounds , and by these estimations we proved the direct part of the slepian wolf theorem and channel coding theorem for general sources and channels

symmetric tensor operations arise in a wide variety of computations however , the benefits of exploiting symmetry in order to reduce storage and computation is in conflict with a desire to simplify memory access patterns in this paper , we propose a blocked data structure \( blocked compact symmetric storage \) wherein we consider the tensor by blocks and store only the unique blocks of a symmetric tensor we propose an algorithm by blocks , already shown of benefit for matrix computations , that exploits this storage format by utilizing a series of temporary tensors to avoid redundant computation further , partial symmetry within temporaries is exploited to further avoid redundant storage and redundant computation a detailed analysis shows that , relative to storing and computing with tensors without taking advantage of symmetry and partial symmetry , storage requirements are reduced by a factor of o left \( m ! right \) and computational requirements by a factor of o left \( \( m 1 \) ! 2 m right \) , where m is the order of the tensor however , as the analysis shows , care must be taken in choosing the correct block size to ensure these storage and computational benefits are achieved \( particularly for low order tensors \) an implementation demonstrates that storage is greatly reduced and the complexity introduced by storing and computing with tensors by blocks is manageable preliminary results demonstrate that computational time is also reduced the paper concludes with a discussion of how insights in this paper point to opportunities for generalizing recent advances in the domain of linear algebra libraries to the field of multi linear computation

in a basic related key attack against a block cipher , the adversary has access to encryptions under keys that differ from the target key by bit flips in this short note we show that for a quantum adversary such attacks are quite powerful if the secret key is \( i \) uniquely determined by a small number of plaintext ciphertext pairs , \( ii \) the block cipher can be evaluated efficiently , and \( iii \) a superposition of related keys can be queried , then the key can be extracted efficiently
